
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Last summer I took some time off from work to study intensive Attic Greek at the University of Washington.  It was awesome, would totally recommend, and I did‚Ä¶ fine.  However, I feel like I got at most 70-80% of the content absorbed, and it absence of a forcing function its all just going to leak out of my brain again.
So, my goal is to work back through the content, once more with feeling.  And slower, that was seriously way too much at once.  We did a chapter or two a day, which meant a couple new grammatical structures a week, which is not really an enjoyable pace. This time I‚Äôd like to do a chapter or two a <strong>week</strong>, still lots of drills and practice, but with time to let it sink in before starting another topic.<br></p>

<p>
But I need help, I am just not a person that does things unless other people care about it, so I‚Äôm hoping some of you will play a log at home, and poke me when I forget.  <br> </p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>Each week I will post enlightening comments about another chunk of Greek grammar and structure.  My previous class worked through <span class="booktitle"><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Alpha-Omega-Beginning-Course-Classical/dp/1585103918">From Alpha to Omega</a>, by Anne Groton</span><a href="#smile-note">*</a>, which is a pretty exhaustive cover of Attic Greek Grammar, though I have some issues with the text book structure.  That the last line in the book is ‚ÄúIt being necessary, I shall punish you‚Äù pretty much expresses what I think the author felt about the students.  This is a quality, exhaustive, and authoritative text for Greek, but accessible it ain‚Äôt.<br></p>
<p>Digging around it looks like the other dominant text is <span class="booktitle">Mastronarde‚Äôs <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Introduction-Attic-Greek-Donald-Mastronarde/dp/0520275713">Introduction to Attic Greek</a></span>, which seems to be much more student friendly also has some nice resources online.  My goal is to work through this text, pulling in stuff from my notes, and from Groton and a couple other resources (see <a href="biblio.html">Bibliography</a>), and sort of summarize my takeaways from each section.  I‚Äôm also going to pull together the tools that I found I needed or build the tools that I thought I needed but didn‚Äôt find, so its overall a smoother experience. <br> </p>

<p> I‚Äôm also going to pull in some stuff from some other books (see bibliography) since I don‚Äôt really know this stuff. <br> </p>

<h2>Where do you come in?</h2>
<p>Ok, so I need people to come along for the ride.  I‚Äôve had a bunch of folks say they were interested in it, but that they totally don‚Äôt have time to do what I did.  I mean, who does?  Greek is pretty cool to know (esp if you are in science or medicine), but it‚Äôs definitely one of those things which is more cool to have learned than it is to learn.  So, we‚Äôre going to take this nice and easy.  Like chill out on Sunday night, easy, not like pressure and stuff.  Hopefully it will give you some stuff to think about, and there will be some stuff to memorize, but we‚Äôre going to take our time.  My goal is to have this fit in nicely to the casual hobby level of commitment, we‚Äôll see if that happens or not.
What I‚Äôm not going to do is actually teach the stuff, because frankly I don‚Äôt know it that well, that‚Äôs sort of the point, right?  If you want to play along at home, you‚Äôll need to get one or the other of the texts.  I‚Äôm going to work through Mastronarde but will cross index to Groton as much as possible.    As well as cite stuff I‚Äôve pulled from the other works.<br> </p>

<h2> What‚Äôs with the website?</h2>
<p>I haven‚Äôt made a website from scratch in like 20 years.  This is my excuse to learn up on modern stuff, outside of the Amazon internal tools ecosystem.  Expect things to change periodically, as I play with stuff, but hopefully I can figure out how to get some of the tools I want to make work.  Or not, then we‚Äôre all stuck using Quizlet! <br> </p>
<p>With that, <a href="begin.html">lets begin</a>!<br> </p>
